“REMAKE MY ENTIRE RESTAURANT MENU WEBSITE FROM SCRATCH IN REACT WITH FIREBASE DATA FLOW”

You are designing a world-class, single-page React.js restaurant menu website that fetches live data (categories and dishes) from Firebase. My current site already works, but now I want to rebuild the entire UI/UX from scratch with a completely new layout, structure, animations, and design principles.

🎯 Objective:
Reimagine the entire front-end. Remove all existing layout/structure. Start fresh.
Create a restaurant menu website that:

Looks stunning at first glance
Feels premium, modern, and aesthetic
Uses Firebase dynamic data (for categories and dishes)
Works on all devices, especially mobile
Uses color themes and animations that mesmerize visitors
⚙️ Tech Stack:
Use React.js
Use Framer Motion for beautiful smooth animations
Use Styled Components or CSS Modules (no plain CSS or Tailwind)
Use Firebase Firestore for live data (data already set up)
Use React Context or clean props for data flow
Use modern design system architecture (components, utils, styles, hooks)
📦 Firebase Data:
Structure remains same:

categories: Each has id, name, image
items: Each has id, name, category_id, image, price, description, isVeg
Data is already working and fetched via Firestore
Design must be 100% compatible with this structure

🧱 NEW PAGE STRUCTURE:
✅ Sticky elegant header (with logo + nav scroll links)
✅ Hero Section (greeting, tagline, optional background or animated shape)
✅ Menu display area (completely restructured, animated, category-based view)
✅ Floating filter button (toggle Veg/All or Category jump)
✅ Optional badges (e.g., Veg, Best Seller, Spicy)
✅ Scroll-to-top button after scroll
✅ Footer with links, branding

🎨 UI/UX & DESIGN PRINCIPLES:
✅ Colors:

Use premium, pleasing color palette
Example palette:
Primary: Deep Tomato Red #e53935 or Royal Coral
Accent: Midnight Navy #1e1e2f
Background: Soft cream #fefcf9 or light beige
Greens: For veg badges #43a047
Use gradients, overlays, and contrast where needed — but very tastefully
✅ Typography:

Use Playfair Display or Merriweather for headings (elegant serif)
Use Inter or Poppins for body text (modern sans-serif)
Fluid scaling, never hardcoded pixels
✅ Imagery:

Dish images must be shown in card-style layout
Categories have optional wide banners
Use placeholder or Unsplash/Firebase image URLs
✅ Layouts:

Grid-based layout for desktop, stacked for mobile
Responsive across all sizes (320px to 1920px)
Use flex/grid with max-widths and auto-margins
✅ Component Design:

Modular components:

<Header />
<HeroSection />
<MenuCategory />
<MenuItemCard />
<Footer />
Each component animated with Framer Motion
Categories animate in on scroll, items fade in staggered
✅ Mobile First:

Tap-friendly UI
Thumb navigation ease
Large fonts
Responsive cards
Animated open/close filter, sticky header
✅ Accessibility:

Contrast safe colors
Keyboard friendly where needed
Alt tags on all images
🧩 Menu Display Logic:
Dynamic loop over Firebase categories
Each category:
Image + Name (styled and animated)
List of menu items filtered by category ID
Menu item card:
Dish image
Name (large & bold)
Price
Optional description (if exists)
Veg tag (green label or dot)
Optional badges ("Best Seller", "Spicy") based on properties
If a category has no items, auto-hide
If item missing image or description, fallback display
💫 Animations:
Use Framer Motion throughout:
Page entrance: fade + slide
Scroll-triggered category reveal
Menu item cards staggered in with delay
Hover effects (scale or lift)
Button interactions (spring/bounce)
Optional animation of filters toggle/floating actions
✅ Final Result Expectations:
Website feels like a premium food app or international-level restaurant site
Visitors should go "wow" on opening it
Design must not feel templated or auto-generated
Firebase dynamic data flows in beautifully without glitches
Fully optimized for mobile, tablet, and desktop
Extremely clean code, scalable component system
Easy to extend with addons like dark mode, QR print, multi-language
